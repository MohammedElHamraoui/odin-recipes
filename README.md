**Project: Recipes** Foundations Course

In this project, we build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to
a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time we’ve 
finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just 
to build our HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to 
style it up with CSS.
